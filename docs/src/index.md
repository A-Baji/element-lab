# Element Lab for storing lab information


DataJoint Element for lab metadata. DataJoint Elements collectively standardize and automate data collection and analysis for neuroscience experiments. Each Element is a modular pipeline for data storage and processing with corresponding database tables that can be combined with other Elements to assemble a fully functional pipeline.

+ `element-lab` features a DataJoint pipeline design for lab related information, such as Lab, User, Project, Protocol, Source.

+ `element-lab` is not a complete workflow by itself, but rather a modular design of tables and dependencies. 

+ `element-lab` can be flexibly attached to any DataJoint workflow.
