# Element Lab for storing lab information

DataJoint Element for lab metadata. DataJoint Elements collectively standardize and
automate data collection and analysis for neuroscience experiments. Each Element is a
modular pipeline for data storage and processing with corresponding database tables that
can be combined with other Elements to assemble a fully functional pipeline.

This Element ...

- features a DataJoint pipeline design for lab related information, such as Lab, User,
  Project, Protocol, Source.

- is not a complete workflow by itself, but rather a modular design of tables and
  dependencies. 

- can be flexibly attached to any DataJoint workflow.

Visit the [Concepts page](./concepts.md) for more information on Element Lab.
To get started with building your data pipeline navigate to the [Tutorials](./tutorials.md) page.
