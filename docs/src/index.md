# DataJoint Element - Lab

+ `element-lab` features a DataJoint pipeline design for lab related information, such as Lab, User, Project, Protocol, Source.

+ `element-lab` is not a complete workflow by itself, but rather a modular design of tables and dependencies. 

+ `element-lab` can be flexibly attached to any DataJoint workflow.
