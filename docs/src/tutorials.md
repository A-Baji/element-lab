Installation of the Element requires an integrated development environment and database.

[User Instructions](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/user-guide/) page. 

## Element usage

`element-lab` is not a complete workflow by itself, but rather a modular design of
tables and dependencies that can be flexibly attached to any DataJoint workflow.

See the
[workflow-calcium-imaging](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-calcium-imaging) and
[workflow-array-ephys](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-array-ephys) repositories
for example usages of `element-lab`.
